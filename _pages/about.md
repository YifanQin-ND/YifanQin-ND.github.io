# About

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu) at the University of Notre Dame. My research focuses on efficient and robust machine learning systems, efficient LLMs inference and deployment, and models optimization under system constraints. Before my PhD, I received a bachelor's and master's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

You can find my CV [here](/files/YifanQin_CV_ML_.pdf).

I am actively seeking industry internships and full-time opportunities.

# Efficient and Robust ML Inference: End-to-End System Demo

* 06/2024 **Real-Time Ventricular Arrhythmia Detection: Efficient ML Inference System** — ACCESS Center, HK

  Developed an end-to-end machine learning inference system for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia detection under strict latency and energy constraints.  
  The system demonstrates how efficient and robust ML inference can be achieved in realistic deployment environments.

  Key techniques include:
  - Quantization- and pruning-aware model design to reduce inference cost while preserving detection accuracy  
  - System-aware inference optimization to meet real-time latency and energy budgets  
  - End-to-end validation with real-time monitoring, illustrating reliable deployment of ML models in safety-critical settings

  **Demo snapshots:** real-time inference pipeline, hardware-integrated deployment, and monitoring interface.

* 02/2025 **Uncertainty-Aware ML Inference for Real-Time Ventricular Arrhythmia Detection** — ISSCC, San Francisco
  
  Developed an uncertainty-aware machine learning inference system for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia detection under strict energy and reliability constraints.

  The system integrates Bayesian neural network inference with uncertainty quantification to enable reliable decision-making under:
  - Out-of-distribution (OOD) input data  
  - Hardware non-idealities variations  
  - Ultra-low energy budgets (1.75 μJ per inference)

  I led the design of the ML algorithms and uncertainty modeling, and contributed to end-to-end system integration and real-time monitoring, demonstrating robust deployment of uncertainty-aware ML inference in safety-critical environments.

  **Demo snapshots:** real-time uncertainty-aware inference pipeline and system validation.
