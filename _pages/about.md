# About

I am a 4th-year PhD candidate from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu), University of Notre Dame. My research interest includes efficient and robust AI accelerator, software/hardware codesign, and efficient LLM. Now I am very fortunate to work with Prof. Yiyu Shi and Prof. X. Sharon Hu, University of Notre Dame. Before my PhD study, I received BS and MS degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

You can find my CV [here](/files/Yifan_CV.pdf).

Feel free to contact me if you have any idea or project to share, email: yqin3 [at] nd [dot] edu.

# Chip Demo

* 06/2024 **Life-Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmia Detection Soft/Hard-ware Co-Design Accelerator (AC-Codesign V1)** ‚Äî‚ÄîAccess center, HK  

  Designed and implemented a convolutional neural network system for ventricular arrhythmia detection with a 40nm LP TSMC CNN accelerator, delivering a deployable chip demo. Full-stack design from UI to backend achieves substantial reductions in inference latency and energy consumption through optimized quantization and pruning techniques, demonstrating high-performance real-time detection capabilities.
